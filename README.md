Mines is one of the most popular "Stake Originals" games due to its simple mechanics and the level of control it gives you over your own risk. It is essentially a gambling version of the classic PC game *Minesweeper*.

### **How the Game Works**

The game is played on a **5x5 grid** containing 25 face-down tiles. Under these tiles are two types of items: **Gems** and **Mines**.

1. **Set Your Stakes:** Before you start, you choose your **Bet Amount** and the **Number of Mines** (from 1 to 24) you want hidden on the board.
2. **The Objective:** Click on tiles to reveal gems.
* **Find a Gem:** Your current payout multiplier increases. You can choose to **Cash Out** immediately or keep clicking to try for a higher multiplier.
* **Hit a Mine:** The round ends instantly, and you lose your entire bet for that round.


3. **The Multiplier:** The more mines you choose to have on the board, the faster the multiplier grows with each gem you find. Conversely, with only one mine, the multiplier grows very slowly.

### **Key Game Mechanics**

* **House Edge:** Mines has a very low house edge of **1.00%**, meaning the Return to Player (RTP) is **99%**. This makes it one of the "fairest" games on the platform.
* **Maximum Win:** The potential payout can reach up to **5,000,000x** your bet, depending on the number of mines and gems found.
* **Provably Fair:** Like all Stake Originals, Mines uses a cryptographic hashing system that allows you to verify that each round's mine placement was truly random and not manipulated.

### **Popular Strategies**

Because you can adjust the difficulty, players often use specific betting styles:

| Strategy | Setup | Goal |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **The "Safe" Grind** | 1 Mine | Pick 1 or 2 tiles and cash out. High win rate, but very small profits. |
| **The "1:1" Ratio** | 1 Mine | Set the bet to a fixed amount and only click one specific tile every time. |
| **High Volatility** | 10+ Mines | Aim to find just 2 or 3 gems. The multiplier jumps significantly with more mines. |
| **Martingale** | Variable | Double your bet after every loss and reset after a win (requires a large bankroll and is risky). |

### **Helpful Features**

* **Auto Mode:** You can set the game to play automatically for a certain number of rounds. You can even program it to increase or decrease your bet based on whether you won or lost the previous round.
* **Pick Random:** If you're feeling indecisive, there is a button that will pick a random tile for you.

> **Note:** While the 99% RTP is high, Mines is still a game of chance. The "house" always has a slight mathematical advantage over the long term, so it's important to set a budget and know when to cash out.
